# MS-Irrigation-Guideline-Evaluation

## Project Purpose
This repository serves as a central hub for documenting, testing, and peer-reviewing an irrigation scheduling guideline for corn in the Mississippi Delta region. The goal is to evaluate the guideline's effectiveness under various climatic and soil moisture conditions, using data from weigh lysimeters, remote sensing, and field observations.

## Target Crop
- **Crop**: Corn (Zea mays L.)

## Region
- **Region**: Mississippi Delta (humid/sub-humid climate)

## Repository Structure
- `GUIDELINE.md` – Full text of the irrigation scheduling guideline.
- `analysis/` – Directory containing analysis scripts and reports comparing guideline recommendations with measured data.
- `data/` – Placeholder for sample datasets (e.g., lysimeter ETc, soil moisture indices).
- `issues/` – (Optional) Folder linking to GitHub issues that define evaluation tasks.

## How to Contribute
Researchers and practitioners are invited to:
1. Review the guideline in `GUIDELINE.md`.
2. Participate in the evaluation tasks described in the **Issues** section of this repository.
3. Submit pull requests with additional analyses, improvements, or corrections.
